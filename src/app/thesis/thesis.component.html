        My bachelor thesis for the programme Software Engineering and
        Management. In this thesis project, investigiated if Natural Language Processing techniques
        may help detect textual inconsistencies between safety artefacts.

        <b>Abstarct:</b> This paper investigates a method that helps detect
        inconsistencies between safety-critical systemsâ€™ textual safety
        artifacts that safety cases rely on by involving NLP techniques. A
        design science research study was conducted in three iterations. I
        evaluate the method by conducting different experiments. The designed
        artifact identifies inconsistencies between different texts that are
        connected by trace links by checking similarities and word vectors of
        the texts. The results indicate that involving NLP technique word
        embedding can help with consistency classification. In conclusion, NLP
        techniques may help detect inconsistencies between safety artifacts that
        safety cases rely on, which is helpful to reduce the risk of system
        failures.

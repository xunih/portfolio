        I'm from China. I am currently a master's student studying interactive
        media technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. I
        studied for my bachelor's degree in software engineering and management
        at University of Gothenburg.

        I am passionate about interaction design, web and mobile development,
        machine learning, and how to use technologies to help improve women's
        health. Equipped with sufficient skills in both software engineering and
        interaction design area, I hope I can contribute to improving human life
        quality and our planet.

        In my spare time, I like listening to music, baking, taking part in
        voluntary work, and going to concerts. Most importantly, I love cats
        very much!
